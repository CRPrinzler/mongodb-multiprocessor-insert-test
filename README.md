# mongoDB Multiprocessor Insert Test

## But why?

I just wanted to have script, which could test load a std. mongoDB instance on a single core virtualbox VM running Ubuntu 22.04.

## This code sucks
Yeah, maybe....but it works for my use case. Feel free to adapt it to your own preferences & projects.

## Running this

```python3 insert.py```

You need to install **halo**.

```pip3 install halo```


## Enjoy
